<p>Fragrances can react differently on different skin types due to body chemistry. Always test a fragrance on your skin before committing to ensure it lasts and smells as expected.</p>
<h2>Tips for Making Your Perfume Last Longer in Warm Weather</h2>
<p>Warm weather can cause perfume to evaporate more quickly, so follow these tips to keep your scent lasting throughout the day:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apply to Moisturized Skin</strong>: Perfume lasts longer on hydrated skin, so apply an unscented lotion before your fragrance.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Pulse Points</strong>: Apply fragrance to areas like the wrists, neck, and behind the ears for maximum longevity.</li>
<li><strong>Use a Matching Body Lotion</strong>: Layering with a scented body lotion from the same fragrance line helps boost the scent’s staying power.</li>
